# How to setup

Clone repository to home directory. (I recommend to clone there.)

```
cd
```

Execute one of the following commands as you like.

```
# from Github
git clone git@github.com:kaosf/dotfiles.git
git clone git://github.com/kaosf/dotfiles.git # read only
git clone https://github.com/kaosf/dotfiles.git # read only

# from Bitbucket
git clone git@bitbucket.org:kaosf/dotfiles.git
git clone https://bitbucket.org/kaosf/dotfiles.git # read only
```

Move to dotfiles directory and run setup.sh. Then the symbolic links are generated.

```
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
